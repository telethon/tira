	*Cleaned up the sources to utilize the autotools,
	by moving all the sources files into 'src', and 
	revwirintg configure.ac.

	*Added the doc directory to the project.

	*Added a man-page for the project as a duplicate from
	http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/ipbt/ipbt.html
	which ships with the project, for the section 1 - User Commands.

	*Dropped HALIBUT portion of the configure.ac.
	man-pages are now handled by autotools.

	*Dropped the malloc/realloc/error portion of 
	configure.ac and Makefile.am (src/Makefile.am).

	*Configured the Project to ship all required 
	sourcefiles without modyfing bin_PROGRAMS (ie putty.h,
	puttyps.h, puttymem.h,...).
